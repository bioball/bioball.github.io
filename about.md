Hi there. Welcome to the inside of my mind, where my ramblings are manifested digitally.

I am a software engineer at a small toy robotics startup called Play-i, in San Mateo. During the day, I mostly build JavaScript heavy applications, and when I'm not working you might find me playing guitar, or drinking coffee, or strolling through the city streets.

I'm just some dude, and I reside in the fair city of San Francsico.
