### Who is this guy?

Hi there! My name is **Dan Chao**, and I am a software engineer, specializing in full-stack web development. You can ask me just about anything about JavaScript and I can probably give you the answer, and am quite adept with Ruby as well.

I am currently attending [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com), an intensive coding school for web development, and am also participating in [Famo.us](http://famo.us) private beta program, where I am contributing to the development of their revolutionary pre-release framework.

Feel free to check out my projects on github, or contact me if you'd like.
