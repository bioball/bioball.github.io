about Dan Chao (赵浩洋)
======================

Hi there! I am a software engineer who specializes in full-stack web development. I mainly write in JavaScript, although I do a fair amount of work in Ruby as well. My main areas of focus are on Backbone, Angular, Node, Express, Rails and Sinatra.

I am currently attending [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com), an intensive coding school for web development, and am also participating in [Famo.us](http://famo.us) private beta program, where I am contributing to the development of their revolutionary pre-release framework.

In my spare time, I am a musician. I used to teach guitar and music theory professionally, and before that was a guitar performance major in college. I also play saxophone and piano.

Feel free to explore my twitter or github, or [email me](mailto:daniel.h.chao@gmail.com) if you'd like.
