about Dan Chao (赵浩洋)
======================

Hi there. Welcome to the inside of my mind, where my ramblings are manifested digitally.

I am a musician disguised as a software engineer. I find great value in expressing myself through code, and building products that influence people. With that said, I work mainly in JavaScript in the web development sector, with copious bits of Ruby thrown in. I am an Angularist, Backbonite, CSS/SASSer, Expressist, Noder, Ruby on Railser, Sinatralite, and am among the first people to be a Famo.user. I also just made up all of those adjectives.

I reside in San Francsico, and you're likely to find me hanging around coffee shops, maybe writing this next blog post.
